# Subjects

1. Given a sorted array [x] of integers and f(x)=x^x function, write a program that will produce a sorted array [y] with y[i]=f(x[i]) elements in O(n) time.
2. Write a program that will count the number of inversions in an array in O(nlogn) time.
3. Given nxn matrix, where n is a positive integer, write a program that will clockwise rotate the matrix 90 degrees. Write the non-in-place version using O(nxn) space.
4. Write the in-place version for problem3 using O(1) space. E.g.: Input: n=4 matrix: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Output: 13 9 5 1 14 10 6 2 15 11 7 3 16 12 8 4.
5. Given a string of words separated by spaces. Write a O(n) program to reverse the string. E.g.: Input: "abc ef" Output: "fe cba".
6. Write a O(n) program to reverse the words in a string. E.g.: Input: "abc defg hi klmn" Output: "klmn hi defg abc".
